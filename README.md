    ```
    //keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))

    signingConfigs {
    // release {
    // keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
    // keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
    // storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
    // storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
    // }
    }
    buildTypes {
    // release {
    // signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    // }
    }
    ```
